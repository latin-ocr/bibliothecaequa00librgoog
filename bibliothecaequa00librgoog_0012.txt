Public Library,· chiefly, though notexclulively‚ approprieted
to their use, lhould consrst of anurneroua Colledtion of valu-

able and well· cholen books. There are many such at present
in this Colle‘dtion5 but many others are yet wanting, both

. autient and modern, ιιι order to increase us utility and estima-

tion as a Public Library, The Britilh Mus curn, Sion Col-
lege Library, end the Univertity Libraries, receive great
additions of modernbooks, from its being required by law,

that copies of all Works entered at Stationers Hall lhould be .

»sent to thole Libraries. But the Library ιιι Rod- Crols Street
has no luch resource, and ιι is, therefore, much to bedesrred‚
that thole liberal· minded persons, who may be inclined to
promote an augmenta tion of the Library, should make such
donatione lor this 'purpose as they may judge proper. Doria-
tions, with this neu, may be either ιιι Books or in Money;
and ιι would also be domante, that luch Authors, whether
Ditlenters or others, as may be inclined to increase the.
library, thould transmit Copies of their Works to this Col
le elion.

Bencfadlions of Books may be lent to the Library' ιιι Red
Crosa Street, and will be entered by the Librarian, with the
names of the Donors‚ in abook appointed for that purpose3
and any Donations in Money‚ which will allo be recorded in ’
thelame book, may be paid into the hands of Mellre. Longa,
llun, Towgood, and Cazalet, Bankers, Clement’s-Lane,
