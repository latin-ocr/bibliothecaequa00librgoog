THIS Lihmry wns founded· in pursuance of the will of
..Do william, who died in the year 1716: With nview to·
ne onnon of ,a pawn noroy, he noo purchaoo, n nn' ’
life-time, the valuoble Colledtion of Dr. Bam, to which ho
diroded by his Will, thot his own {hould be added. ⁸Of
dhese aCatologue was pointed, in one volume, 8vo, in
1727, some confideroble time before a Public Library was
openod3 ond the catalogue was publissned previoussy to the
*opening of the Libram, ao the Prefoee informs uo, in order
toinduoe other munificent ond public-spirited persons, and
lovers of Litemture, to contribute to its angmentation. Con-
fidemble donations to this Library have accordingly been
made at different times; but not such os hove been propor-
tionable to the long space of time which has elapsed fince the
foundation of the Library, nor ῑο the usual liberality manifested
by the Diffenters on suc'h occafions. Although it was known, χ
’ that Dr. Willdoms, the Founder of the Library, bad left a
confideroble estate, which wos appropriated to various chori·

that hjs Trustoes were not empowered by his Will to mnplo'yn
any part of the producens his estoto in ¹the purchnse of Books
